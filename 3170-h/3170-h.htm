<p style="text-align: center"><i>PRICE ONE PENNY</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>I have
looked at this claim by the light of history and my own
conscience, and it seems to me so looked at to be a most just
claim, and that resistance to it means nothing short of a denial
of the hope of civilisation.</p>
<p>This then is the claim:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>It is right and necessary that all men should have work to
do which shall be worth doing</i>, <i>and be of itself pleasant
to do</i>; <i>and which should be done under such conditions as
would make it neither over-wearisome nor over-anxious</i>.</p>
<p>Turn that claim about as I may, think of it as long as I can,
I cannot find that it is an exorbitant claim; yet again I say if
Society would or could admit it, the face of the world would be
changed; discontent and strife and dishonesty would be
ended.&nbsp; To feel that we were doing work useful to others and
pleasant to ourselves, and that such work and its due reward
<i>could</i> not fail us!&nbsp; What serious harm could happen to
us then?&nbsp; And the price to be paid for so making the world
happy is Revolution.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE DAY
IS COMING.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Come</span> hither lads,
and hearken, for a tale there is to tell,<br />
Of the wonderful days a-coming when all shall be better than
well.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the tale shall be told of a country, a land
in the midst of the sea,<br />
And folk shall call it England in the days that are going to
be.</p>
<p class="poetry">There more than one in a thousand in the days
that are yet to come,<br />
Shall have some hope of the morrow, some joy of the ancient
home.</p>
<p class="poetry">For then&mdash;laugh not, but listen, to this
strange tale of mine&mdash;<br />
All folk that are in England shall be better lodged than
swine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then a man shall work and bethink him, and
rejoice in the deeds of his hand,<br />
Nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to stand.</p>
<p class="poetry">Men in that time a-coming shall work and have
no fear<br />
For to-morrow&rsquo;s lack of earning and the hunger-wolf
anear.</p>
<p class="poetry">I tell you this for a wonder, that no man then
shall be glad<br />
Of his fellow&rsquo;s fall and mishap to snatch at the work he
had.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>For that which the worker winneth shall then be his
indeed,<br />
Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no
seed.</p>
<p class="poetry">O strange new wonderful justice!&nbsp; But for
whom shall we gather the gain?<br />
For ourselves and for each of our fellows, and no hand shall
labour in vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then all <i>mine</i> and all <i>thine</i> shall
be <i>ours</i>, and no more shall any man crave<br />
For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a
slave.</p>
<p class="poetry">And what wealth then shall be left us when none
shall gather gold<br />
To buy his friend in the market, and pinch and pine the sold?</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, what save the lovely city, and the little
house on the hill,<br />
And the wastes and the woodland beauty, and the happy fields we
till.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the homes of ancient stories, the tombs of
the mighty dead;<br />
And the wise men seeking out marvels, and the poet&rsquo;s
teeming head;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the painter&rsquo;s hand of wonder; and the
marvellous fiddle-bow,<br />
And the banded choirs of music:&mdash;all those that do and
know.</p>
<p class="poetry">For all these shall be ours and all
men&rsquo;s, nor shall any lack a share<br />
Of the toil and the gain of living in the days when the world
grows fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! such are the days that shall be!&nbsp; But
what are the deeds of to-day,<br />
In the days of the years we dwell in, that wear our lives
away?</p>
<p class="poetry">Why, then, and for what are we waiting?&nbsp;
There are three words to speak.<br />
<span class="smcap">We will it</span>, and what is the foeman but
the dream-strong wakened and weak?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>O why and for what are we waiting? while our brothers
droop and die,<br />
And on every wind of the heavens a wasted life goes by.</p>
<p class="poetry">How long shall they reproach us where crowd on
crowd they dwell,<br />
Poor ghosts of the wicked city, the gold-crushed hungry hell?</p>
<p class="poetry">Through squalid life they laboured, in sordid
grief they died,<br />
Those sons of a mighty mother, those props of England&rsquo;s
pride.</p>
<p class="poetry">They are gone; there is none can undo it, nor
save our souls from the curse;<br />
But many a million cometh, and shall they be better or worse?</p>
<p class="poetry">It is we must answer and hasten, and open wide
the door<br />
For the rich man&rsquo;s hurrying terror, and the slow-foot hope
of the poor.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched, and
their unlearned discontent,<br />
We must give it voice and wisdom till the waiting-tide be
spent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, then, since all things call us, the
living and the dead<br />
And o&rsquo;er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is
shed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, then, let us cast off fooling, and put by
ease and rest<br />
For the <span class="smcap">cause</span> alone is worthy till the
good days bring the best</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, join in the only battle wherein no man
can fail,<br />
Where whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still
prevail.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! come, cast off all fooling, for this, at
least we know:<br />
That the Dawn and the Day is coming, and forth the Banners
go.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>THE
VOICE OF TOIL.</h2>
<p class="poetry">I heard men saying, Leave hope and praying,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All days shall be as all have been;<br />
To-day and to-morrow bring fear and sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The never-ending toil between.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Earth was younger mid toil and hunger,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope we strove, and our hands were strong<br />
Then great men led us, with words they fed us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bade us right the earthly wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go read in story their deeds and glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their names amidst the nameless dead;<br />
Turn then from lying to us slow-dying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In that good world to which they led;</p>
<p class="poetry">Where fast and faster our iron master,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing we made, for ever drives,<br />
Bids us grind treasure and fashion pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For other hopes and other lives.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where home is a hovel and dull we grovel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting that the world is fair;<br />
Where no babe we cherish, lest its very soul perish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where our mirth is crime, our love a snare</p>
<p class="poetry">Who now shall lead us, what god shall heed
us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As we lie in the hell our hands have won<br />
For us are no rulers but fools and befoolers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The great are fallen, the wise men gone</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>I heard men saying, Leave tears and praying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sharp knife heedeth not the sheep;<br />
Are we not stronger than the rich and the wronger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When day breaks over dreams and sleep?</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, shoulder to shoulder ere the world grows
older!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Help lies in nought but thee and me;<br />
Hope is before us, the long years that bore us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bore leaders more than men may be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let dead hearts tarry and trade and marry,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trembling nurse their dreams of mirth,<br />
While we the living our lives are giving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring the bright new world to birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, shoulder to shoulder ere earth grows
older!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cause spreads over land and sea;<br />
Now the world shaketh, and fear awaketh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And joy at last for thee and me.</p>
<h2><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>ALL FOR
THE CAUSE.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Hear</span> a word, a word
in season, for the day is drawing nigh,<br />
When the Cause shall call upon us, some to live, and some to
die!</p>
<p class="poetry">He that dies shall not die lonely, many an one
hath gone before,<br />
He that lives shall bear no burden heavier than the life they
bore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nothing ancient is their story, e&rsquo;en but
yesterday they bled,<br />
Youngest they of earth&rsquo;s belov&euml;d, last of all the
valiant dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">E&rsquo;en the tidings we are telling was the
tale they had to tell,<br />
E&rsquo;en the hope that our hearts cherish, was the hope for
which they fell.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the grave where tyrants thrust them, lies
their labour and their pain,<br />
But undying from their sorrow springeth up the hope again.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mourn not therefore, nor lament it that the
world outlives their life;<br />
Voice and vision yet they give us, making strong our hands for
strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">Some had name, and fame, and honour,
learn&rsquo;d they were, and wise and strong;<br />
Some were nameless, poor, unlettered, weak in all but grief and
wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">Named and nameless all live in us; one and all
they lead us yet<br />
Every pain to count for nothing, every sorrow to forget.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Hearken how they cry, &ldquo;O happy, happy ye that ye
were born<br />
In the sad slow night&rsquo;s departing, in the rising of the
morn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Fair the crown the Cause hath for you,
well to die or well to live<br />
Through the battle, through the tangle, peace to gain or peace to
give.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, it may be!&nbsp; Oft meseemeth, in the days
that yet shall be,<br />
When no slave of gold abideth &rsquo;twixt the breadth of sea to
sea,</p>
<p class="poetry">Oft, when men and maids are merry, ere the
sunlight leaves the earth,<br />
And they bless the day belov&euml;d, all too short for all their
mirth,</p>
<p class="poetry">Some shall pause awhile and ponder on the
bitter days of old,<br />
Ere the toil of strife and battle overthrew the curse of
gold;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then &rsquo;twixt lips of loved and lover
solemn thoughts of us shall rise;<br />
We who once were fools and dreamers, then shall be the brave and
wise.</p>
<p class="poetry">There amidst the world new-builded shall our
earthly deeds abide,<br />
Though our names be all forgotten, and the tale of how we
died.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life or death then, who shall heed it, what we
gain or what we lose?<br />
Fair flies life amid the struggle, and the Cause for each shall
choose.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hear a word, a word in season, for the day is
drawing nigh,<br />
When the Cause shall call upon us, some to live and some to
die!</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Saith</span> man to man,
We&rsquo;ve heard and known<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That we no master need<br />
To live upon this earth, our own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fair and manly deed.<br />
The grief of slaves long passed away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For us hath forged the chain,<br />
Till now each worker&rsquo;s patient day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Builds up the House of Pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">And we, shall we too, crouch and quail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashamed, afraid of strife,<br />
And lest our lives untimely fail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace the Death in Life?<br />
Nay, cry aloud, and have no fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We few against the world;<br />
Awake, arise! the hope we bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the curse is hurled.</p>
<p class="poetry">It grows and grows&mdash;are we the same,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The feeble band, the few?<br />
Or what are these with eyes aflame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hands to deal and do?<br />
This is the host that bears the word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">No Master high or

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> is this, the
sound and rumour?&nbsp; What is this that all men hear,<br />
Like the wind in hollow valleys when the storm is drawing
near,<br />
Like the rolling on of ocean in the eventide of fear?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the people marching on.</p>
<p class="poetry">Whither go they, and whence come they?&nbsp;
What are these of whom ye tell?<br />
In what country are they dwelling &rsquo;twixt the gates of
heaven and hell?<br />
Are they mine or thine for money?&nbsp; Will they serve a master
well?<br />

wonder,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the host comes marching on.</p>
<p class="poetry">Forth they come from grief and torment; on they
wend toward health and mirth,<br />
All the wide world is their dwelling, every corner of the
earth.<br />
Buy them, sell them for thy service!&nbsp; Try the bargain what
&rsquo;tis worth,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the days are marching on.</p>
<p class="poetry">These are they who build thy houses, weave thy
raiment, win thy wheat,<br />
Smooth the rugged, fill the barren, turn the bitter into
sweet,<br />
All for thee this day&mdash;and ever.&nbsp; What reward for them
is meet?<br />

12</span>Many a hundred years passed over have they laboured deaf
and blind;<br />
Never tidings reached their sorrow, never hope their toil might
find.<br />
Now at last they&rsquo;ve heard and hear it, and the cry comes
down the wind,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And their feet are marching on.</p>
<p class="poetry">O ye rich men hear and tremble! for with words
the sound is rife:<br />
&ldquo;Once for you and death we laboured; changed henceforward
is the strife.<br />
We are men, and we shall battle for the world of men and life;<br

Come and live! for life awaketh, and the world shall never
tire;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And hope is marching on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;On we march then, we the workers, and
the rumour that ye hear<br />

MESSAGE OF THE MARCH WIND.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Fair</span> now is the
springtide, now earth lies beholding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the eyes of a lover, the face of the sun;<br />
Long lasteth the daylight, and hope is enfolding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The green-growing acres with increase begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now sweet, sweet it is through the land to be
straying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid the birds and the blossoms and the beasts
of the field;<br />
Love mingles with love, and no evil is weighing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy heart or mine, where all sorrow is
healed.</p>
<p class="poetry">From township to township, o&rsquo;er down and
by tillage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far, far have we wandered and long was the day,<br
/>
But now cometh eve at the end of the village,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where over the grey wall the church riseth grey.</p>
<p class="poetry">There is wind in the twilight; in the white
road before us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The straw from the ox-yard is blowing about;<br />
The moon&rsquo;s rim is rising, a star glitters o&rsquo;er us,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the vane on the spire-top is swinging in
doubt.</p>
<p class="poetry">Down there dips the highway, toward the bridge
crossing over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brook that runs on to the Thames and the sea.<br
/>
Draw closer, my sweet, we are lover and lover;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This eve art thou given to gladness and me.</p>
<p class="poetry">Shall we be glad always?&nbsp; Come closer and
hearken:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three fields further on, as they told me down
there,<br />
When the young moon has set, if the March sky should darken,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We might see from the hill-top the great
city&rsquo;s glare.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Hark, the wind in the elm-boughs!&nbsp; From London it
bloweth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And telleth of gold, and of hope and unrest;<br />
Of power that helps not; of wisdom that knoweth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But teacheth not aught of the worst and the
best.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of the rich men it telleth, and strange is the
story<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How they have, and they hanker, and grip far and
wide;<br />
And they live and they die, and the earth and its glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has been but a burden they scarce might abide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hark! the March wind again of a people is
telling;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the life that they live there, so haggard and
grim,<br />

<p class="poetry">This land we have loved in our love and our
leisure<br />

The wide hills o&rsquo;er the sea-plain for them have no

&nbsp;&nbsp; The grey homes of their fathers no story to
teach.</p>
<p class="poetry">The singers have sung and the builders have
builded,<br />

delight;<br />
For what and for whom hath the world&rsquo;s book been gilded,<br

night?</p>
<p class="poetry">How long, and for what is their patience
abiding?<br />

How here in the spring-tide the message shall find us;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the hope that none seeketh is coming to
light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like the seed of midwinter, unheeded,
unperished,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the autumn-sown wheat &rsquo;neath the snow
lying green,<br />
Like the love that o&rsquo;ertook us, unawares and
uncherished,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the babe &rsquo;neath thy girdle that groweth
unseen.</p>
<p class="poetry">So the hope of the people now buddeth and
groweth&mdash;<br />

It biddeth us learn all the wisdom it knoweth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It hath found us and held us, and biddeth us
hear:</p>
<p class="poetry">For it beareth the message: &ldquo;Rise up on
the morrow<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
